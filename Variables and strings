a = 10
b = 3
here a and b are variables
we can perform arithemetic operatios +, - , * , /
Here in division we get result in float value if we code in higher version of Phyton 3.7
To get only integer we can use //
To get modulo use %
/n means new line
print('ananth's program') gives syntax error due to mismatch of "'".  1. print("ananth's program") 2. print('ananth\'s program')
print('c:\ananth\new\program') will result like c/ananth  and in the next line ew/program. To avoid this issue we can code like 
print (r'c:\ananth\new\program')
